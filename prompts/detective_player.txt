Your goal is to solve the case by finding the murderer among the 4 suspects.

Location: {location}

CURRENT STATE:

MY PREVIOUS ACTIONS:
{history}

AVAILABLE TOOLS (Costs Points):
1. get_location(phone_number) [2 pts]: Check where a suspect was at specific times.
   - Valid Phones:
{suspect_phones}

2. call_alibi(alibi_id, question) [1 pt]: Call a suspect's alibi witness.
   - Ask the suspect for their 'Alibi ID' first!

3. get_footage(camera_name) [3 pts]: Watch security footage. Unlocks physical evidence.

5. interrogate(suspect_id, question) [0 pts]: Chat with a suspect.
6. accuse(suspect_id) [0 pts]: Accuse a suspect. WARNING: Wrong accusation advances round. 3 strikes = LOSS.

STRATEGY:
- Start by gathering general evidence (Footage) or questioning suspects to get their stories.
- Cross-reference stories with Location data.
- Use DNA to confirm presence at the crime scene.
- If a suspect lies about their location or alibi, press them.
- Only ACCUSE if you are 80% sure or running out of points.
